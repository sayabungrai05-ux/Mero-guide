    <div class="overlayeve">
        <p>The Everest Base Camp trek on the south side, at an elevation of 5,364 m (17,598 ft), is one of the most popular trekking routes in the Himalayas and about 40,000 people per year make the trek there from Lukla Airport (2,846 m (9,337 ft)).[5] Trekkers usually fly from Kathmandu to Lukla to save time and energy before beginning the trek to the base camp. However, trekking to Lukla is possible. There are no roads from Kathmandu to Lukla and as a result, the only method of transporting large and heavy goods is by plane.<br>On 25 April 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the moment magnitude scale, struck Nepal and triggered an avalanche on Pumori that swept through the South Base Camp. At least 19 people were said to have been killed as a result. Just over two weeks later, on 12 May, a second quake struck measuring 7.3 on the Mw. Some of the trails leading to Everest Base Camp were damaged by these earthquakes and needed repairs.

        </div>
        <div class="overktm">
            <p>Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley is home to hundreds of sacred sites, and to a distinct and authentic form of Buddhism practiced by the Newar people. Lacking a monastic tradition, the Newars instead directed their worship to chivas and chaityas, or shrines, which abound in the urban landscape and the sacred topography of the valley. Chivas were and have continued to be erected in the memory of a deceased family member for the accumulation of merit by the deceased, by members of surviving generations, and by all sentient creatures. But instead of being limited to private devotion as funerary monuments, chivas instead became the focus of public worship for members of the community, as almost all of them are in public or semi-public spaces.

                Chivas appear in a range of scales, from the monumental, like the mahachaitya, or “great chaitya,” of Swayambhunath down to sizes less than the height of a person. The oldest of them were erected in the Licchavi period, named after the ancient kingdom that ruled the Kathmandu Valley between the fifth and eighth centuries, while a revival of the construction of chivas took place in the seventeenth century. The typical votive chiva resembles a building in miniature, sitting on a plinth, adorned with carvings at different levels, and surmounted by a dome and prominent finial. Representing some of the best stone architecture in Nepal, the carved decoration depicts the saints and divinities of the Newari Buddhism pantheon, including the five versions of the Buddha and a profusion of Bodhisattvas. The shrines also contain carved inscriptions that address the sacred object directly and give information about the donor and the year of its creation. Some even contain admonitions not to destroy the shrine and warn of terrible consequences for those who do.</p>

          <p>Lumbinī (Nepali: लुम्बिनी pronounced [ˈlumbini] (listen), "the lovely") is a Buddhist pilgrimage site in the Rupandehi District of Lumbini Province in Nepal. It is the place where, according to Buddhist tradition, Queen Mahamayadevi gave birth to Siddhartha Gautama at around 566 BCE.Gautama, who, according to Buddhist tradition, achieved Enlightenment some time around 528 BCE,became Gautama Buddha and founded Buddhism.Lumbini is one of many magnets for pilgrimage that sprang up in places pivotal to the life of the Buddha.

            Lumbini has a number of older temples, including the Mayadevi Temple, and various new temples, funded by Buddhist organisations from various countries, have been completed or are still under construction. Many monuments, monasteries and a museum, and the Lumbini International Research Institute are also within the holy site. Also, there is the Puskarini, or Holy Pond, where the Buddha's mother took the ritual dip prior to his birth and where he had his first bath. At other sites near Lumbini, earlier Buddhas were, according to tradition, born, then achieved ultimate Enlightenment and finally relinquished their earthly forms. The Government of Bangladesh is currently constructing a major Buddhist Monastery in Lumbhini.
            
            Lumbini was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.

It consists of steamed rice and a cooked lentil or other pulses stew called dal. It is a staple food in these countries. Bhat or chawal means "boiled rice" in a number of Indo-Aryan languages.

    At higher elevations in Nepal, above 6,500 feet (2,000 m), where rice does not grow well, other grains such as maize, buckwheat, barley or millet may be substituted in a cooked preparation called dhindo or atho in Nepal. Bhat may be supplemented with roti in Nepal (rounds of unleavened bread).
    
    Dal may be cooked with onion, garlic, ginger, chili, tomatoes, or tamarind, in addition to lentils or beans. It always contains herbs and spices such as coriander, garam masala, cumin, and turmeric. Recipes vary by season, locality, ethnic group and family.
    
    Dal bhat is often served with vegetable tarkari or torkari (तरकारी in Hindi, তরকারি in Bengali) – a mix of available seasonal vegetables. It is also called dal bhat tarkari (दाल भात तरकारी) in Nepali and Bengali (ডাল ভাত তরকারি). A small portion of pickle (called achar or loncha) is sometimes included. In Bengal (West Bengal and Bangladesh) dal bhat may accompany machh bhaja (মাছ ভাজা - fried fish).
